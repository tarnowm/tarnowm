### Welcome to my GitHub page!

My name is Martin Tarnowski, I am currently working as a software engineer at Electronic Arts - BioWare.
 - I focus on developing internal tools, such as web-based services, API's and messaging broker technologies.
 - Ensuring reliability across our products, through the use of various monitoring tools and CI/CD pipelines.
 - Developing software that interacts with various SDKs including PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, with a focus in Save Game Libraries.
